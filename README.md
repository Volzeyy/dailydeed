# dailydeed
I commit to doing some techy deed on the daily, mostly just coding a project every day for practice, no matter how little or great it is.
Though I'll take a break on Saturday, Sunday is optional.

Update: I may not be doing any more projects, but I'll see. I came up with an idea I like and I want to focus on creating it. I'm also learning other stuff so you could say I'm taking a little break from tech.
